“Do great designs”. I follow this motto all the time. From the moment I become a designer, this is what was written in my portfolio. However, in my many years of experience, I found that doing great designs simply become a habit, but, paradoxically, it also become more difficult. Having a harsher look at beauty and ugliness while having continual insights and understanding constantly inspire me to work towards “extreme” situations. Producing great designs is a process of self-cultivation. It needs self-doubt, self-affirmation, self-breaking, and self-reconstruction — a repeated challenge. But I have always believed that great design is power. She will give any ordinary things fresh emotions, colors, vibrancy, and imagination. And I prefer to treat her as a sentimental person. I hope that my designs will create more surprises.

There is no end.
